## Why You might need this?

You might want to do smart commit and want to be precise how much time you took to complete this feature, use samaya which looks at previous commit and finds out how much time has passed since then.

## Why smart commit?

Every ticket/task on a project board has an estimation about when will it get completed, developers working on the ticket/task if uses smart commit than at the completion of the ticket we will have the actual time he/she took to complete the ticket/task, which is a very important piece of information. Looking at the ticket/task estimation time and the actual time it took to complete we can now estimate more precisely how much time does a similar weight-bearing task will take. This concept is heavily used in Scrum (Scrum is an agile framework for managing work with an emphasis on software development).
